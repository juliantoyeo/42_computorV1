Note:

Coefficient, Variable
Example:
2x
2 -> Coefficient
x -> Variable

Terms = the combianation of Coefficient and Variable, (2x) is a Terms

Find like Terms
Example:
2x^2 + 3x + 5 + 1x
like Terms = 3x, 1x

Negative Coefficient
Example:
2x^2 - 6x + 6 can be interprated as:
2x^2 + (-6)x + 6
Dont treat "-" sign as minus, but treat it as a indicator that the Coefficient attached to it is a Negative one.

To calculate discriminant
D = b^2 - 4ac
a, b and c each represent the Coefficient of each terms in the equation
D < 0 = Negative discriminant with 2 imaginary solution
D > 0 = Positive discriminant with 2 real solution
D = 0 = 1 real solution

Factoring a polynomials // just for reading and understanding, not really needed to solve this project

Example:
x^2 - 9 is the same as x^2 + 0x^1 - 9

Find the const (the terms without Variable) which is (-9) in this example
Find the factor of (-9) =
1 * -9
-1 * 9
-3 * 3
3 * -3

Test every pair to find the right solution, for example here we use the pair of (-3 * 3)
Open up 2 pair of parantheses
(     )(     )
Factor the 1st terms, in this case x^2 which will give us (x * x)
Put each of the result into the pairs of parantheses
(x    )(x    )
Now put in the example factor of (-9) that we pick earlier (-3 * 3)
Put each of the result into the pairs of parantheses like what we did earlier
(x - 3)(x + 3)

Now we test if this factored form is the correct one.
First we Multiple the 1st terms from each of the parantheses 
x * x = x^2 -> result1
Next we do (1st terms of 1st parantheses * 2nd terms of 2nd parantheses)
x * 3 = 3x -> result2
Next we do (2nd terms of 1st parantheses * 1st terms of 2nd parantheses)
-3 * x = -3x -> result3
Lastly we Multiple the 2nd terms from each of the parantheses  
-3 * 3 = -9 -> result4

Arranged the result as following:
result1 + result2 + result3 + result4
x^2 + 3x + (-3)x + (-9) ==
x^2 + 0x^1 + (-9) ==
x^2 - 9

This is proof that the factor of x^2 - 9 is (x - 3)(x + 3)

to solve 2 degree:
discriminant formula : b^2 - 4ac
quadratic equation (or 2nd degree polynomials) formula :
-b + sqrt(discriminant) / 2a
-b - sqrt(discriminant) / 2a

Positive discriminant:
"5 * X ^ 0 + 13 * X ^ 1 + 3 * X ^ 2 = 1 * X^0 + 1 * X^1"

Null discriminant:
"6 * X ^ 0 + 11 * X ^ 1 + 5 * X ^ 2 = 1 * X ^ 0 + 1 * X ^ 1"

Negative discriminant:
"5 * X ^ 0 + 3 * X ^ 1 + 3 * X ^ 2 = 1 * X ^ 0 + 0 * X^1"

to solve 0 degree:
if the reduced form ends up as 0 = 0, all real number is answer, (this could happens to degree 1 and degree 2 as well)
if both side is not equal, means there is no solution
example : 4 * X ^ 0 = 8 * X ^ 0
reduced form = - 4 * X^0 = 0 or - 4 = 0
both side is not equal, therefore no solution

to solve 1 degree:
5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 = 4 * X^0
reduced form = 1 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 = 0
or 1 + 4x = 0
4x = -1
x = -1/4
